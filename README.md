# Insurgent Social Engineering Dataset

This dataset examines how insurgent groups use reproductive violence and forced marriage as tools of social organization, cohesion, and state-building.

## Overview
  **Replicates and extends:** [Soules' Rebel Appeals and Incentives Dataset (RAID)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00220027231154813) and the [Forced Marriage by Non-State Armed Groups (FM-NSAG)](https://www.ipinst.org/2023/04/forced-marriage-by-non-state-armed-groups-frequency-forms-and-impact)) dataset.
  **Key Contribution:** Introduces the 'bundled_rfm' variable, which codes for the adoption of rape and forced marriage by inurgent groups as a potential indicator of strategic social engineering. This datset further splits insurgent groups into two dsitinct groups (secular militant groups vs religious extremist groups).
  **Status:** Active development for graduate research on insurgent governance, reproductive violence and political violence.

#### Research Focus
This data supports a research project theorizing that:
1.  Religious extremist groups are significantly more likely to employ reproductive violence as a core strategic practice compared to secular militant groups
2.  Extremist groups use forced marriage and reproductive violence as a deliberate tool for insurgent state-building.

##### Future Development
This dataset is intended to be expanded, notably by incorporating forced pregnancy data from Lindsey Goldberg's work- ('Womenâ€™s roles and reproductive violence within armed rebellions') to further test hypotheses about social engineering versus opportunistic violence.
