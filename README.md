# insurgent_reproductive_violence
A dataset analysing insurgent groups use of reproductive violence as a social engineering tool.

##### Data Description ######
This dataset replicates and extends three major datasets:
- Michael Soules' *"Rebel Appeals and Incentives Dataset (RAID)"*
- Phoebe Donnelly & Emily Myers' *"Forced Marriage by Non-State Armed Groups (FM-NSAG)"*
- Lindsey Goldberg's *"Women's roles and Reproductive Violence within armed rebellions"*

The dataset introduces new variables and further categorizes insurgent groups into two distinct categories: *secular militant groups* vs *religious extremist groups*.

**Status**: Active development for graduate research on insurgent governance, reproductive violence, and political violence.

###### Research Focus ########
This data supports a research project theorizing that:

1. *Religious extremist groups* are significantly more likely to employ reproductive violence as a core strategic practice compared to secular militant groups
2. *Extremist groups* use forced marriage and reproductive violence as a deliberate tool for insurgent state-building
3. The absence of forced abortion in religious extremist groups provides evidence for the argument that the adoption of forced marriage is likely to meet societal building goals.
